Some species, especially Laetiporus sulphureus, are commonly known as sulphur shelf, chicken of the woods, the chicken mushroom, or the chicken fungus because it is often described as tasting like and having a texture similar to that of chicken meat. The name 'chicken of the woods' is not to be confused with another edible polypore, Maitake (Grifola frondosa) known as 'hen of the woods/rams head' or with Lyophyllum decastes, known as the 'fried chicken mushroom'. The name Laetiporus means 'with bright pores'.",

Caution must be used when identifying chanterelles for consumption due to lookalikes, such as the Jack-O-Lantern species which can make a person very ill. Despite this, chanterelles are one of the most recognized and harvested groups of edible mushrooms.",

This shell encloses the seed (or 'kernel') which is edible in many species (such as almonds) but poisonous in others (such as apricots).
